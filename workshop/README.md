## Using AWS documentations to DIG DEEP more about S3 Bucket Policy, AWS CLI s3 command, and AWS CLI s3api commands, Besides Append new knowlege at your document, Also learn how to fork a GitHub repo, The all topic to cover listed below in details

* Dig deep into S3 policy
* Get familiar with AWS CLI s3 commands.
* Get familiar with AWS CLI s3api command,
* Define the diffrencies between S3 and S3api commands.
* Append new knowlege to your document.
* Fork this repo and append you code samples.
* Regarding AWS commands, Focusing on how to get and put objects.


At the end of the week you should submit your list of what did you learn, and what you intend to learn next week, This helps you to track you self more. Then share with the DevOps Workshop Champs community your summarization document in order to help advance your documentaions writing skills.


Week Three Workshop
At the end of the week, submit the following workshop.
use IaC Terrafrom to build the following resource besides requirement specifications:
In the following task will walk through the S3 creation, create IAM users and roles, configure S3 Policy, and test accessibility using AWS CLI s3 and s3api using IAM user credentials and IAM Role credentials using Terrafrom

* Use S3 to store Terraform statefile using "erakiterrafromstatefiles" bucket
* Consider to use difrrent name that others (i.e. specify a unique name for state file key)
* Create a general purpose Bucket.
* Create a Directory under created S3 called "logs".
* Create two IAM Users (Mostafa, Taha).
* Create IAM Role for Taha have s3:GetObject policy from logs directory only.
* Set an S3 Policy allow Mostafa to put objects (i.e. s3:PutObject) at the entire S3.
* Check accessability using AWS CLI:
    *  Utilizing AWS CLI s3 commands.
    * Utilizing AWS CLI s3api commands.
*  After all Create a fork from this repository, Then append your code at the code samples section below and request to accept.
